## Chngelog

Scraped redirection to login page as I do not think that is good user experiences.
If user enters user name wich already exist (as he does not have to know about it)
will use JS to handle the form check and and then redirect via Python

Created rest API for profile data

v 1.0 :
	- Finished general idea for profiles and API
v 1.1 :
	- Added game section (list) to app_data as well as added section in the data for Riddle game
	- Added geme data creation
